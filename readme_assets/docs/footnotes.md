    <span id="note">Note:</span>

    It is technically possible to make the rule work with these variables by playing with the rule's secondary option, that is, by providing a regex to `ignoreProperties.transform` to describe a new acceptable property value pattern for `transform` that accounts for the use of variables.

    But constructing such regex is not trivial, as `transform` takes value in a wide range of forms, ranging from non-functional keywords, like `none` and `initial`, to more than a dozen transform functions that take varying number of arguments (consider `matrix3d()`, specified with 16 values, and `translateX()`, which accepts only one), and the combination of any number of these functions.
